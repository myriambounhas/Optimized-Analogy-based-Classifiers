# Optimized-Analogy-based-Classifiers
This project supports the paper : Revisiting analogical proportions and analogical inference, Bounhas and Prade, (submitted to IJAR2023).
The project provides the implementation of two analogical classifiers: k-AC and Baseline classifiers as developped in Bounhas et al., 2017. 
It also includes two NEW optimized classifiers of these basic procedures using analogical proportions with /without patterns having all values equal.
The project requires adding the two weka jar files available in the project.
The Boolean functions tested in this paper are also available in the dataset folder.
